ScanLink
Overview
ScanLink is a QR code authenticator that verifies identity through a connected database. This project is designed for use cases where seamless, reliable identity verification is needed. ScanLink is built to integrate modern database checks and straightforward user feedback through LED indicators.

Features
QR Code Authentication: Scans and extracts ID and name from QR codes.
Database Verification: Checks extracted information against a database for validation.
Visual Indicators: Green LED for successful verification and red LED for failed authentication.
Web-based Dashboard: (Future implementation) Admin dashboard for data management and monitoring.
Technology Stack
Hardware: Arduino for QR code scanning and LED control.
Software:
Backend: Flask framework.
Database: PostgreSQL for data storage and verification.
Frontend: Minimal interface to display authentication results.
Programming Languages: Python, C/C++ (for Arduino).
